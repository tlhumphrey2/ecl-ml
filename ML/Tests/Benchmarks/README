Each learning algorithm should have 2 entries/test programs in this folder:
1. Small test program that compares the model produced with the model produced by the equivalent algorithm in R (this file should end with '_verify_model.ecl'.
2. Test program that determines the speed of execution of the algorithm during learning on a large dataset (this file should end with '_runtime_on_large_trainingset.ecl'.

The first program should be tested on both THOR and HTHOR. And, the dataset should have some zero values for some of the independent variables. Furthermore, the program
 should create the model with the zeros in and removed. And, the model produced for both should be the same model.

For the 2nd program (ran on large dataset), it only needs to be run on THOR. But, the dataset should contain some zero values for independent variables. 
And the learning should be done with and without zeros in the independent variables. The model should be the same with and without zero valued independent
variables.
