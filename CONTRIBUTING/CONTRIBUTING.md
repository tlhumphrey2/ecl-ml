We love having new contributors join us! Here's the quick summary of where to find information on contributing to the ML Project:

* Guidance for [beginning contributors](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/ecl-ml/CONTRIBUTING/BeginnerContributorGuidelines.md)
* Read our current needs in [CurrentNeeds.md](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/ecl-ml/CurrentNeeds.md). For now, we are limiting contributions to just those in CurrentNeeds.md. Although, any suggestions related to our current needs would be most welcomed.
* If you have questions or comments about contributing, please post them on our [Contributors forum](https://hpccsystems.com/bb/viewforum.php?f=29) (And at the beginning of the subject line of your post, put "ML:", i.e. ML colon).
